				<p>… a stone, a leaf, an unfound door; of a stone, a leaf, a door. And of all the forgotten faces.</p>
				<p>Naked and alone we came into exile. In her dark womb we did not know our mother’s face; from the prison of her flesh have we come into the unspeakable and incommunicable prison of this earth.</p>
				<p>Which of us has known his brother? Which of us has looked into his father’s heart? Which of us has not remained forever prison-pent? Which of us is not forever a stranger and alone?</p>
				<p>O waste of loss, in the hot mazes, lost, among bright stars on this most weary unbright cinder, lost! Remembering speechlessly we seek the great forgotten language, the lost lane-end into heaven, a stone, a leaf, an unfound door. Where? When?</p>
				<p>O lost, and by the wind grieved, ghost, come back again.</p>
